                <h3>Who I Am</h3>
                <p>
                    I'm a recent Computer Science graduate from Hunter College (December 2025) with hands-on 
                    experience implementing security architectures across endpoint, mobile, and system-level 
                    environments. My work focuses on translating security concepts into practical implementations 
                    that solve real business problems.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Currently supporting campus security operations at Hunter College Public Safety while pursuing 
                    entry-level security engineering and IT positions in New York City. I bring a combination of 
                    academic foundation, practical implementation experience, and genuine enthusiasm for solving 
                    complex technical challenges.
                </p>
                
                <div class="separator"></div>
                
                <h3>My Approach</h3>
                <p>
                    I approach security through a defense-in-depth lens: understanding that effective security 
                    requires multiple independent layers working together. Whether it's implementing access control 
                    systems, hardening endpoints, or deploying encryption, I focus on creating resilient architectures 
                    that maintain security even when individual controls are compromised.
                </p>
                
                <p>
                    My projects demonstrate capability in areas that translate directly to enterprise environments: 
                    access control design, endpoint hardening, encryption implementation, mobile device security, 
                    and compliance-driven architecture. I don't just implement tools—I understand the "why" behind 
                    security decisions and can articulate business value alongside technical details.
                </p>

                <h3>Beyond the Technical</h3>
                <p>
                    Outside of security implementations, I stay active through running (former track athlete), 
                    exploring New York City's neighborhoods, and connecting with people from diverse backgrounds. 
                    I thrive on learning new technologies and tackling unfamiliar challenges—the more complex 
                    the problem, the more engaged I become.
                </p>
                
                <p>
                    What drives me isn't just solving technical puzzles—it's understanding how security solutions 
                    protect real organizations and enable them to operate confidently. Whether it's preventing 
                    internal theft through access control systems or enabling compliant AI usage through air-gapped 
                    architectures, I'm motivated by creating practical value from technical implementations.
                </p>

                <p>
                    If you're looking for someone who combines technical capability with business awareness, 
                    who can implement sophisticated security solutions while explaining their value clearly, 
                    and who's genuinely excited about solving challenging problems—let's connect.
